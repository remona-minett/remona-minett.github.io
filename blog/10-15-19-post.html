    <h1>The Surface Neo sounds too good to be true, plus discussion on blurred lines in the device market.</h1>
    <i style="font-size: 75%; color: grey;">Posted on October 15th, 2019 at 11:27 PM. | Edited November 22, 2019 at 12:05 AM.</i><br>
    <p>Dual screens. Full Windows experience. Portable. Touchscreen.</p>
    <p>That's what Microsoft says the new <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-neo">Surface Neo</a> is going to be. A strange laptop-tablet hybrid with a giant hinge in the middle holding two separate screens together.</p>
    <p>I can't imagine the battery life will be any good. Nor the graphics capabilities. Does anyone recall the Pixel Slate? It had a bottom-end Celeron powering it. Nobody liked it, it ran terribly, it could hardly do standard web browsing on Chrome OS of all things.</p>
    <p>The Neo is two nine-inch screens stuck together, with a bezel as well. I can appreciate the fact that they didn't attempt to make it a single screen that folds. We know how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/18/galaxy-fold-samsung-investigates-as-screens-break-in-first-days"> that turned out</a>.</p>
    <p>The hinge is 360 degrees, which offers some strange &quot;scrape the other screen along your lap as you use one&quot; functionality.
    The size is awkward. Smaller than an average laptop, larger than an average tablet. It won't go in your pocket, nor will it be secure in a backpack.</p>
    <p>Essentially, this is a regular Surface tablet without the removable keyboard, and it is another screen. I can't imagine someone opening up their Surface Neo and reading it like a book or something.</p>
    <p>Don't forget too, that it does <i>not</i> run x32 applications. Apparently they are run through some sandboxing service on a Microsoft server of some sort.</p>
    <p>This feels somewhat akin to someone using CAD Mobile. Ridiculous, I mean. Why use certain devices to accomplish certain tasks, when others are much better suited for it? Sure, circumstances can demand specific tasks be done in strange ways, but there's certain lines being blurred here with the new devices coming onto the market.</p>
    <p>I belive the divide between portable vs powerful has been blurred too much. People want thin and light laptops, thick and heavy tablets. The whole purpose of the tablet is defeated when phones do what they do, and are nearly as big as this point, not including the Samsung Fold and whatnot. I would like to go back to a phone that folds <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2019/01/28/motorola-razr-v4-can-beat-samsungs-galaxy-x-with-two-features/#421b61e72972">hamburger-style</a> so I can not worry about goughing the screen on stuff in my pocket. It's a phone, not a luxury item. I just need it to do what I need it to do. I have a computer at home for writing, coding, gaming, etc.</p>
    <p>In my opinion, Apple products are a big leading force in the blurred lines issue. iPad Pro made to be a laptop replacement - runs App Store stuff still. iPad Mini - just a phablet at this point. MacBook Air - So thin and light it cooks itself, and can't run anything worth mentioning in the production department. Yet people are still brainless and have to pick up every single Apple product they push out, because &quot;Newer Is Better&quot; or something.</p>
    <p>The entire reason to have a desktop, laptop, tablet and phone as separate devices are all basically gone. Laptops can do VR, code and 3D model just as well as most desktop rigs can. Phones are practically as large as some tablets now and some just open up to be as big as. At this rate most people only have a laptop and a huge phone.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately. still, on the whole subject of devices. there need to be clear cut dividers between what's a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, all-in-one, etc. This Surface Neo, is it a tablet, or a laptop? It's got no keyboard. It's entirely touchscreen. However, it opens on a hinge like a laptop, it runs full windows(to an extent). It also comes with a charger that looks like a phone charger, and a stylus. It wants to be both so badly and I feel like that is where it will fail.</p>
    <p>Perhaps that's where it will succeed. Consumers from both categories will see this device and believe it will be the catch-all to their needs. A laptop-tablet? Perfect! I feel like both will be disappointed. Full-featured Windows is not what tablet users want. On the same hand, full mobile tablet layout is not what laptop users want. Don't forget that half the programs on the Neo will be sandboxed on microsoft's cloud infrastructure too, depending on what programs you decide to run on it.</p>
